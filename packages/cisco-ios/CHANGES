  - Added an internal live-status command to force a resync of all cached
     encrypted values used by NedSecrets. Useful to solve an issue where the

     Issue like this:
      admin@ncs# devices device <devname> live-status exec any "secrets resync"

cisco-ios v5.0.2 [January 06, 2017]
===================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

    WARNING:
    Calculating southbounds diffs using nso-4.0.4 may take "forever" due to
    a NSO bug (Issue tracker: #22205). Manifests when CDB contains many vlans.
    If you think you are experiencing this problem, upgrade to nso-4.0.5.

    WARNING:
    Using NSO-4.3 branch you must upgrade to minimum NSO-4.3.0.2 in order for
    NedSecrets and NedDefaults to work. If you are not, you will get a compare-
    config diff when setting cleartext passwords which the device encrypts. You
    may also get a compare-config diff on some config hidden by the device.
    The problem can also be seen in the logs as an exception:
      "... com.tailf.cdb.CdbException: Not a cdb operational data path"

Enhancements:

  - Added type 7 password to crypto-key-grouping used in 10+ places.
    (CISCOIOS-453 / RT26356)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     aaa group server radius * / server-private *
     interface * / ip pim passive
     ip tcp selective-ack
     monitor session * type erspan-source
     mpls discovery vpn
     route-map * / match local-preference
     router bgp * / neighbor * path-attribute discard * in
     spd headroom
    (CISCOIOS-451 / RT26310)

  - Include "ip addressd dhcp" in vrf-forwarding-restore ned-setting, i.e. if
     vrf is modified on an interface with DHCP, the DHCP setting is restored.
    (CISCOIOS-449 / RT26284)

  - Changed cisco-ios-auto / vrf-forwarding-restore ned-setting to default true.

  - Replaced internal debug command 'show fixed-config' with 'sync-from-file'
    The internal live-status exec any sync-from-file command is used to inject
    a config file in NETSIM. The next 1 sync-from will sync-from this file.
    For example:
      admin@ncs# devices device netsim-0 live-status exec any "sync-from-file
         /home/myuser/cisco-test-config.yxy"
      admin@ncs# devices device netsim-0 sync-from

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     interface * / ip ospf network
      Changed from leaf to leaf-list in order to support setting both
      point-to-multipoint and non-broadcast.
     (CISCOIOS-452 / RT26319)

  - Set interface * / service instance * ethernet / bridge-domain after
     interface * / service instance * ethernet / l2protocol.

    If you think you are experiencing this problem, upgrade to nso-4.0.5.

    WARNING:
    NedSecrets and NedDefaults do not work with NSO-4.3 or NSO-4.3.0.1 due to
    a problem with Navu and CDB. The problem will manifest as a config diff
    when device encrypts cleartext secrets. To fix this, you must upgrade your
    NSO-4.3.x to a newer version which includes the fix #15413. Presently none
    available.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Split monitor session * filter packet-type into good & bad, making it
     it possible to configure both simultaneously.
    (CISCOIOS-447 / RT26262)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / glbp *
     ip dhcp pool * / netbios-node-type
    (CISCOIOS-232)

  - Added support for new tailf:meta-data "suppress-no-command" annotation. This annotation
    can be used to suppress the 'no *' command, that can not be removed on the device.
    Added above annotation in // aaa session-id
    (CISCOIOS-223 / RT24134)

Corrections:

  - NED sorts reverse order of 'no line vty .*' commands
    for example consider following two commands:
      - no line vty 12 15
      - no line vty 16 25
    when NED executes 'no line vty 12 15' device also deletes 'no line vty 16 25,
    and when NED sends 'no line vty 16 25' device throws '% Invalid input detected' error,
    so to handle this NED sort the above command in reverse order. delete bigger number first.
    (CISCOIOS-221 / RT24125)

  - Removed when expression in following leafs due to circular references,
     interface/Port-channel/port-channel/load-balance/link

     service-instance mdns-sd
    (CISCOIOS-209)

Corrections:

  - Added default delete in /ip/ssh/client/algorithm/mac and /ip/ssh/client/algorithm/encryption

      - default ip ssh client algorithm encryption
    (CISCOIOS-205)

  - Changed(revert) following leafs type to boolean combined with 'tailf:cli-boolean-no'
      - /cdp/run
      - /interface * /cdp/enable
    (When above leafs have 'tailf:cli-show-no', it  displayed as 'no <name>' when it does not exist.
    This is an issue because not all interface supports 'cdp' command)
    (CISCOIOS-200)

  - Removed / interface * / ip mroute-cache distributed
    (Added ned-settings / cisco-ios-use-ip-mroute-cache-distributed)
    - set to true, if 'ip mroute-cache distributed' should be used instead of 'ip mroute-cache'
    - some devices/versions only allows 'ip mroute-cache distributed' and some devices/versions
      only allows 'ip mroute-cache'. but devices shows 'ip mroute-cache'
      when show running-config is executed. To avoid compare-config diff and
      rollback issue, we can use this ned-setting.
    (CISCOIOS-201)

  - Added tailf:cli-reset-container in /aaa authentication login *
    (CISCOIOS-214)

  - Added tailf:cli-diff-dependency (dependency to /interface *) in // logging source-interface *

       no logging source-interface .*
       no interface .*

       member GigabitEthernet.* service-instance <integer>
     !
    (CISCOIOS-199)

  - Changed following leafs type to empty and added 'tailf:cli-show-no'
      - /cdp/run
      - /interface * /cdp/enable
    (CISCOIOS-200)

  - Added presence statement in route-map * /continue
    (continue command can be configured without sequence-number)
    (CISCOIOS-203)

      no service instance .*
     exit
     no l2vpn xconnect context .*
    (CISCOIOS-194)

  - Added default delete in /ip/ssh/server/algorithm/mac and /ip/ssh/server/algorithm/encryption

    (RT23457)

  - API CHANGE:
    ip community-list <number> has been changed to a single list, from two
    separate ones, in order to allow for easier handling of the new ned-setting
    cisco-ios-auto / ip-community-list-repopulate. This setting is used to

    (RT23438)

Corrections:

  - Fixed interface vrf and ip address dependency problem, correct order is:
     interface * /

cisco-ios v4.3 [June 10, 2016]
==============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - API CHANGE:
    All access-list's collected in a single list /access-list/access-list
    Fixed bug with editing entries. The device deleted the entire acl when a
    single rule was deleted but NSO did not. This has now been fixed by having
    NCS repopulate the ACL list after a rule delete.
    (RT23353)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
    interface * / ip ospf authentication key-chain
    key chain * / key * / cryptographic-algorithm

    (RT23350)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / service instance * ethernet / encapsulation untagged , dot1q
    (RT23328)

  - Rewrote the implementation for replacing encrypted device secrets with
    the cleartext cdb value in order to avoid compare-config diff and out
    of sync with service. The new design requires support for tailf:meta-data
    which means the minimum NCS/NSO versions had to be raised accordingly.
    All transformed secrets on the device should now be supported.
   (RT22669)

  - Added support for passing answers to prompts in live-status exec and
    config exec commands. Append '| prompts <answer1> [answer2]' to command.
    Note: For hitting enter only on a prompt, add the prompt key 'ENTER'
    Examples:
     admin@ncs(config-config)# exec "key config-key password-encrypt cisco123 | prompts cisco123"

    Also implemented a ned-setting - cisco-ios-auto-prompts - which can be
    used to register standard answers to standard questions. For example:
    devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-ios-auto-prompts Q1 question
      "System configuration has been modified" answer "no"
    See README file for more info.
   (RT22669)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     interface * / service instance * ethernet / encapsulation
    changed to a choice instead of separate entries.

  - Fixed service instance dependency problem, correct order is:
     interface * / service instance * ethernet /
      encapsulation
      bridge-domain
    (RT23328)

  - Improved suppport for setting type 6 passwords on device.

  - Fixed switchport vs ip address dependency using Java, correct order:
     interface *
      no switchport
      ip address
    (RT23219)

  - Warning: Ignore info string "propagating wred configuration to" when
    modifying wrr-queue random-detect no-list
    (RT23001)

  - Default: Fixed default value problem with line * / login authentication
    (RT22801)


cisco-ios v4.2.3 [June 3, 2016]
===============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
    event manager applet * / event timer * name|ratelimit
   (RT23265)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     ip msdp
   (RT22924)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     policy-map * / class * / random-detect *-based aggregate
     policy-map * / class * / random-detect precedence values *
    (RT23235)

  - Added new optional method to show running-config: cisco-ios-show-running-method
    Example:
    devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-ios-show-running-method "show running-config full"

  - Added cisco-ios-inject-config ned-settings in order to inject config to
    top of running-config. Example:
     devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-ios-inject-config test config "version TEST"
    (RT23163)

  - Set ned-settings cisco-ios-cached-show-enable to default to true.


Corrections:

  - Fixed another bridge-domain dependency issue, correct order is:
     no interface BDI *
     no bridge-domain *
    (RT23020)

  - API CHANGE:
     route-map * / match route-type *
    In order to support multiple output syntax.
    (RT23150)

  - Added unique statement on vrf definition / rd
    If duplicate, device responds: '% "rd" 1:1 already in use by VRF X'
    (RT21072)

  - Added missing default values:
    ip ssh time-out 120
    ip ssh authentication-retries 3
   (RT22801)

  - Removed confusing ip prefix-list config without seq number.
    Note: always specify seq, because the device always shows it.
    (CISCOIOS-55)

  - BUGFIX: do not insert delete of policy-map / class / bandwidth|priority percent
    unless also adding numbers back.

  - API CHANGE:
     policy-map * / class * / random-detect *-based due to support for 'aggregate'
    (RT23235)

  - API CHANGE:
    route-map * / set as-path prepend remodelled. Changed to same design as
    in cisco-nx, a multi-value string instead of 10 leaves.
    (RT22669)

  - Fixed the interface switchport order dependency;
     - interface *
        no ip address
        switchport
    (RT23219)

  - Modified the last sethook (interface / switchport create) to set
   'no ip address' instead of delete '[no] ip address' if C650* device
    since those devices show:
     interface *
      switchport
      no ip address
    where most IOS devices only show:
     interface *
      switchport
    (RT23219)

  - Removed two more sethooks due to not working well with FASTMAP:
     interface / switchport
      (delete: set 'no ip address' on interface)
     interface Port-channel.
      (delete: deleted channel-group on all Ethernet interfaces with same id)
    Add/delete dynamic config manually in transaction to avoid config diff.
    (RT23219)

  - Fixed the following interface switchport order dependencies:
     - interface *
        no ip address X
        switchport
     - interface *
        speed X
        duplex full
     - interface *
        no switchport port-security
        no switchport mode access
     - interface *
        mode access
        no switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

    (RT22785)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ip verify source vlan dhcp-snooping
    (CISCOIOS-129)

  - Additional support for configuring passwords/keys in cleartext which get

     mpls ldp neighbor *
     radius-server host * key
     tacacs-server host * key
     username * password

    (RT22801)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
    Changed 'crypto ikev2 keyring * / peer * / pre-shared-key' YANG in order
    to support cleartext to encrypted device conversion without config diff.
    (RT22669)

  - API CHANGE:
     Type change uint16 to string: route-map * / match as-path *
     Removed string pattern on: route-map * / match ipv6 address
    (RT23078)

  - API CHANGE:
     aaa new-model - empty to boolean in order to support 'no aaa new-model'

    (RT22978)


cisco-ios v4.2.0 [May 13, 2016]
===============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     cable service class * activity-timeout
     cable service class * admission-timeout
     cable service class * max-latency
     cable service class * min-packet-size
     cable service class * req-attr-mask
     cable service class * req-trans-policy
     cable service flow activity-timeout
     cable multicast mdf-disable WB-Incapable-CM
     cable trust *
     cable dsg chan-list * index * freq
     cable load-balance d20-ggrp-default
     cable metering ipdr ? session
     cable rf-change-dampen-time
     cable tag * / service-type-id
     controller Modular-Cable * / rf-channel * network-delay
     interface Modular-Cable* / no cable cm-status enable
      NOTE: Use: cable cm-status enable no-list
     interface Wideband-Cable* / cable ds-resiliency
    (RT22958)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ip flow monitor * input
     interface * / ip flow monitor * output
     interface * / no nhrp route-watch
     router eigrp * / address-family ipv4 / af-interface * / summary-address
     router eigrp * / address-family ipv4 / af-interface * / authentication
    (CISCOIOS-125)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     l2tp-class * / authentication
     l2tp-class * / password
     pseudowire-class * / ip local interface
     pseudowire-class * / protocol
    (CISCOIOS-123)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / bfd template
    (RT22871)

  - Added 'any' exec command under live-status to be able to execute any IOS
    command on the device. For example:
    admin@ncs# devices device ios1921-2 live-status exec any "show ppp summary"

  - Added 'verify' exec command under live-status.
    (CISCOIOS-116)

  - Support for configuring shared secrets in cleartext which get encrypted
    on the device. The encrypted secret from the device is replaced with the
    clear text from the CDB if the device config has not changed. If the
    secret is changed out-of-band the new value will be shown, i.e. cause
    a compare-config diff, which it should.
    The following secrets/keys/passwords are supported:
     enable password
     enable secret
     ip ftp password
     mpls ldp password fallback
     radius-server key
     tacacs-server key
    (RT22801)

  - Added info from output of 'show version in cached-show container in
    tailf-ned-cisco-ios module for fast access in service code. Info is
    updated upon login, i.e. may change if output of show version changes.
    Enable by setting: ned-settings cisco-ios-cached-show-enable version true
    Example output:
      cached-show version version 15.4(3)S4
      cached-show version model ME-3800X-24FS-M
      cached-show version license level MetroIPServices
      cached-show version license type Permanent
    Note: Even though this info is in config, obviously it is not config
          and can not be set on the device.
    (RT22867)

Corrections:

  - Changed most cli-diff-dependency statements to use relative paths instead
    of absolute paths to avoid a bug in ncs-3.4 branch.
    As a result, the following config has changed YANG path:
     ipv6 routing
    (CISCOIOS-127)

  - API CHANGE:
    Changed 'ip forward protocol udp' API in order to allow support for
    no-entries and entries. Remodelled as a list using optional disabled
    keyword. For example: set 'ip forward-protocol udp tftp disabled" for
    'no ip forward-protocol udp tftp'.
    (RT22958)

  - API CHANGE (internal leaves renamed) due to support for hidden secrets:
     aaa group server tacacs+ * / server-private * key
     interface * / standby * authentication md5 key-string
     interface * / vrrp * authentication md5 key-string
     ip ftp password
     key chain * / key * / key-string
     radius server * key
     router lisp / ipv4 etr map-server * key
     tacacs-server host * key
     tacacs-server key
     username * password

  - Removed sethook on crypto pki trustpoint. Add dynamic config manually.
    (CISCOIOS-115)

  - Redesigned confirmation handling when applying config. Always begin by
    sending a 'y'. If no prompt after 1 second, send 'es\n' in order to
    complete a 'yes\n' to avoid getting stuck at questions. Reason for change
    is that now almost all confirmation prompts will be supported.
    (CISCOIOS-115)


cisco-ios v4.1.6 [May 4, 2016]
==============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router lisp / locator-table
     router lisp / loc-reach-algorithm rloc-probing
     router ospf * / redistribute lisp subnets
    (RT22785)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     mpls ldp password fallback
    (RT22800)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ethernet oam link-monitor receive-crc window
     interface * / isis bfd disable
     interface * / isis hello-multiplier
     router ospf * / prefix-priority high route-map
    (RT22802)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     call-home / vrf
     interface * / tunnel mode ipv6
     ip dhcp use vrf remote
     ip dns name-list *
     ip dns view vrf * *
     ip dns view * / domain name-server vrf *
     ip dns view-list * / view vrf * *
     ip dns view-list * / view vrf * / restrict
     parameter-map type inspect-vrf *
     parameter-map type inspect * / tcp syn-flood limit
     parameter-map type inspect * / max-incomplete ?
     parameter-map type inspect * / threat-detection rate fw-drop
     parameter-map type inspect * / threat-detection rate inspect-drop
     parameter-map type inspect * / vrf * inspect
     virtual-service / ip shared host-interface
     virtual-service / activate
    (CISCOIOS-90)

Corrections:

  - Fixed compare-config diff when setting line * / exec, hidden default.

  - Removed ordered-by "user" on snmp-server enable traps list.
    (RT22801)

  - Corrected spelling in 'mpls ldp neighbor * labels accept', was lables
    (RT22803)

  - Special reorder fix for NCS bug manifesting in router ospf / max-metric
    (Fixed in NCS 3.4.5 or newer)

  - Fixed ordering isssues in router * / distribute-list when adding and
    deleting entries.

  - Reviewed and added several vrf dependency cli annotations.

  - Added ipv6 unicast-routing dependency on router bgp * / address-family ipv6.


cisco-ios v4.1.5 [April 28, 2016]
=================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Expanded the YANG model in:
     interface * / dialer map ip *
    (RT22769)

  - sdm prefer expansions to the YANG model.
    (RT22734)

  - Improved and bugfixed login code.
    (RT22712)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router odr
     router ospfv3 * / shutdown

  - Improved drned test system. Removed old lux tests.
    (CISCOIOS-87)

Corrections:

  - Fixed switchport dependency issue, correct order is:
     interface *
      no switchport nonegotiate
      no switchport mode access
    (RT22766)

  - Fixed interface * / mls qos vlan-based vs interface * / service-policy
    dependency problem.
    (RT22748)

  - Added cli-replace-all on 'line * / transport input|output'.
    (RT22717)

  - Removed sethook on 'ip vrf' which used to automatically clear
    'ip vrf forwarding' on all interfaces as well as delete all routes
    using the same vrf. Reason being dynamic sethooks have proven to
    cause problems with FASTMAP as well as cauing unwanted config changes.
    If you want to mimic the device behaviour of cleaning vrf config when
    a vrf is deleted, you have to add those deletes to your transaction
    as well in order to avoid config diff.
    (RT22686)

  - Removed sethook on 'ip routing'. See reason above.

  - Fixed problem with banner in newer NCS/NSO versions.

  - Fixed support for live-status exec reload without giving an error.


cisco-ios v4.1.4 [April 20, 2016]
=================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Made the automatic ip address reconfiguration upon vrf forwarding change
    on interfaces configurable. Default is off. To enable:
     devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-ios-auto vrf-forwarding-restore true
    (RT20304)

  - Answer yes on 'ACCEPT? (yes/[no])' pattern.

Corrections:

  - Fixed interface * /crypto map vs crypto map dependency.
    (RT22592)

  - Answer 'yes' instead of 'y' if prompt regarding destroying certificates.

  - Ignore retry on 'please remove .* from .* first' pattern.

  - Do not accept cisco-ios-inject-interface-config without interface config.


cisco-ios v4.1.3 [April 11, 2016]
=================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     Add output of BOOT path-list from 'show boot' to boot system config
     in order to avoid a diff. Note: For devices which only support one
     boot system entry you have to delete the old entry explicitly since
     cisco-ios supports multiple entries.
    (RT22491)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / lacp min-bundle
     interface * / vrrp * vrrs leader
     interface * / vrrp * address
     interface * / vrrs pathway *
     ipv6 neighbor *
    (CISCOIOS-90)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     boot config
     ip dhcp pool * / bootfile
     interface * / ipv6 dhcp client information refresh minimum
     interface * / ipv6 verify unicast source reachable-via
     interface * / isdn termination multidrop
     interface * / l2protocol peer|forward
     interface * / soak link notification
     interface * / wrr-queue min-reserve
     ip ssh pubkey-chain / username * / key-hash *
     ip ssh rsa keypair-name
     ipv6 spd queue
     line * / logging synchronous level
     mac-address-table move update
     mls qos min-reserve *
     radius-server attribute * mandatory
     route-map * / set ip qos-group
    (CISCOIOS-87)

  - Added a new optional method for NETSIM to calculate transaction id:
     cisco-ios-transaction-id-method confd-state-trans-id
    which uses 'show confd-state internal cdb datastore running transaction-id'

  - Improved login code to be more robust in order to improve chance of
    logging in on devices with banner(s) confusing the login process.

  - Disable additional show commands for show() if non existant to save
    bandwidth.


Corrections:

  - Fixed interface * / channel-group vs interface * / mls dependency.
    (RT22459)

  - Reverted the bad fix in 4.0.5.1 where Port-channel interfaces did not
    show "no shutdown" when shutdown. The reason being, without it it was
    not possible to bring down a newly created Port-channel interface since
    nothing was sent and the interface default to 'shutdown' when created.
    For those who want to create a shutdown Port-channel interface they
    have to set shutdown explicitly when creating the interface to match
    the device which usually brings up Port-channel as shutdown.
    (RT22456)

  - Removed all use of cli-trigger-on-delete since it turns out it has
    no other effect than negating cli-trigger-on-set, making it into a
    normal cli-diff-dependency.
    (TRAC 14332)

  - API CHANGE: mgcp behavior changed from hardcoded config to a list.

  - Ignore set/delete of unsupported injected interface config.

  - Improved snmp-server user config creation from 'show snmp user' and
    added support for access-list info.

  - Set verbose logging to default false. Enable with cisco-ios-log-verbose
    ned-settings option.


cisco-ios v4.1.2 [April 06, 2016]
=================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE: ip forward-protocol udp changed from leaf to leaf-list.
    (RT22007)

  - Reworked switchport API:
     IMPORTANT NOTE: Devices which do not show 'switchport' when enabled
      must configure cisco-ios-inject-interface-config to inject it.
      See the README file.
     'no switchport' is shown on all Ethernet and Port-channel interfaces
      by default (with help of a static global config inject)
     API CHANGES:
      Removed interface * / no-switchport and yes-switchport
       (always use interface * / switchport container)
      Removed tailfned switchport config (show-no and show-yes)
      Removed cisco-ios-switchport-format ned-setting.
      Removed switchport on wlan-ap, BDI, Vlan and Virtual-Template if.
    (CISCOIOS-33)

  - API CHANGE: ipv6 cef

  - Added 'presence true' in 'domain * / vrf * / border' container.
    (RT22068)

    (RT21612) (RT22102)

  - Completely reworked switchport dependencies due to yet another problem.
    (RT22066)

  - Removed sethooks on interface * / vrf forwarding | ip vrf forwarding
     which deleted all IP addresses on interface, introduced in 3.11.0.9.
     One reason was that it stopped reconfiguration of IP address in fastmap.
     Introduced new Java code which automatically writes back the primary IP
     from the CDB to the device if vrf forwarding is modified.
     This will preserve the interface IP address configuration in CDB.
     Note: Code needs to be expanded to also write back secondary addresses.
    (RT20304) (CISCOIOS-61)

  - Added subinterface dependencies to base interface to fix delete problem.

  - API CHANGE: removed support for 'random-detect' without argument.

  - Always use 'random-detect precedence-based' to enable precedence.
     On a real device this config is hidden, showing only 'random-detect',
     but the NED auto-converts that to 'random-detect precedence-based.
    (RT21996)

  - Fixed more mls qos clean up bugs.
    (RT21705)

  - Fixed policy-map * / class * / shape vs queue-limit dependency.
    (RT21989)

  - Joined switchport enable switch and config for show-no devices in order
     to be able to delete separate config when disabling switchport.

    quoting of non-config elements when displaying them.

  - Changed interface * / autonomic connect to type empty.

  - Use 'show vlan' first, fallback to 'show vlan-switch'.

  - Also ignore 'no switchport' incomplete command error.

  - Cleaned netsim/ios.xml start config.

  - Ignore 'switchport' incomplete command error due to the confusing design
    where some ios devices need it and some don't.

  - Fixed order dependency in interface / service instance / encapsulation.

  - Added explicit exit in router lisp / eid-table * mode.
    (#12725)

  - Treat 'already in use by' as an error.

  - Treat 'VLAN .* does not exist, creating vlan' as warning, i.e. ignore.
